Wine installer is a collection of scripts for Bash to manage and
install multiple Wine versions.

To use Wine installer, add following lines to your .bashrc, assuming
that you have extracted this package to $HOME/wine-installer directory:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Environmental variables indicating where Wine installer can be found.
WINE_INSTALLER_PATH="$HOME"/wine-installer
# Different Wine versions are installed to this path by wine-installer.
WINE_INSTALL_PATH="$HOME"/wine-compiles

# Initialize Wine installer functions.
source "$WINE_INSTALLER_PATH"/bash-functions.sh "$WINE_INSTALL_PATH" "$WINE_INSTALLER_PATH"

# Load the newest Wine version on start or system version if one exists.
winever "`winever | tail -n 1`"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this you have two commands that invoke Wine installer
features. First is "winever" that you can use to see what Wine
versions you have on system that are installed by Wine installer and
if there is native Wine version installed on system.

$ winever 1.1.22
$ winever
= 1.1.22
1.1.5
1.1.19
1.1.22
system wine-1.0.1

Tells that you have Wine versions 1.1.5, 1.1.19 and 1.1.22 installed
on your system with Wine installer and that you have native Wine 1.0.1
installed you your system. This also sets the "MANPATH" variable so
that "man wine" will bring the man page of currently used Wine. You
can also see that Wine version 1.1.22 is now in use. 

To reset back into the default Wine version on system, you can use
"winever system":

$ winever system
$ winever
1.1.5
1.1.19
1.1.22
system wine-1.0.1

To install different Wine versions you may use "wineinstall"
command. Just type "wineinstall 1.1.4" and this will
install Wine version 1.1.4 on your system, if you have all the
compilation prerequisites that are needed to successfully compile
Wine.

$ wineinstall 1.1.4
